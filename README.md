# terraform-aws-example
Bridgecrew AWS ReadOnly Integration
Maintained by Bridgecrew.io GitHub tag (latest SemVer) Terraform Version Infrastructure Tests

Installation Options
This is a Terraform module that creates an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Read Only integration with Bridgecrew.

Starting fresh
This stack creates a role with a dedicated External ID which allows only authorized access from Bridgecrew's AWS account

Usage
Include module.readonly.tf in your existing Terraform code, and/or see example/examplea as your guide:

module "readonly" {
  source      = "bridgecrewio/bridgecrew-read-only/aws"
  version     = "v1.5.4"
  org_name    = "<your org name>"
  aws_profile = "<aws profile>"
  api_token   = var.api_token
}
The module requires that you set your Bridgecrew organisation name and the name of the AWS profile of the AWS account you want to attach Bridgecrew too.

The module expect the Bridgecrew platform API token to be supplied.

On Windows:

$env:TF_VAR_api_token="your-platform-token"
On *nix:

export TF_VAR_api_token="your-platform-token"
Or you can leave it blank to be prompted at your console.

Where do I get my Bridgecrew API token
get my API token

SSM example
In the examples folder you'll also find an example that drives this module but obtains the api_token from your AWS SSM parameter store. You'll have to add the variable there once yourself, but any future uses will obtain it without intervention.

aws ssm put-parameter --name /bridgecrew/api_token --value <your_token> --type SecureString
Secrets manager example
Also in the examples folder you'll find an example that drives this module but obtains the api_token, but this time from AWS secretsmanager.

aws secretsmanager create-secret --name /bridgecrew/api_token
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id /bridgecrew/api_token --secret-string <your_token>
